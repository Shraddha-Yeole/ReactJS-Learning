HTML DOM (Document Object Model)

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

DOM defines:

The HTML elements as objects
The properties of all HTML elements
The methods to access all HTML elements
The events for all HTML elements
In other words: ** The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements. **
