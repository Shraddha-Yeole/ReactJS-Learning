HTML DOM (Document Object Model)

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

DOM defines:

The HTML elements as objects
The properties of all HTML elements
The methods to access all HTML elements
The events for all HTML elements
In other words: ** The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements. **


1. Javascript library
2. Describe views (HTML elements) based on states
3. React mount views in borwser's DOM and automatically updates when original state changes.


Why React :
1. HTML : present static data
we can't write dynamic HTML content based on data.(We don't have loops, if statements, or variables in HTML)

When the data we represent with HTML is changed, we need to manually update the HTML to reflect that change. 
For example, when that small business for which you built a website gets a new phone number, itâ€™ll be time to drop into an HTML editor,
make that change, and then upload the new HTML files to the server.

if change is more frequent though, for example, if the business now wants to feature a different product on the home page every hour
HTML is not enough.

Solution 1
JSP and PHP :
Use special tags that will act like loops and conditionals when we need them. JSP and PHP are examples of this.

 AJAX: JavaScript became a standard language that is supported in all browsers, and someone invented AJAX, 
 which allowed us to ask servers questions in the background of a webpage.
 
 Javascript:
 We realized that we could be more efficient in the way we represent our data. 
 Instead of preparing the HTML server-side and shipping it ready to the client, we can send just the data to the client,
 and we'll have the fancy, smart browsers prepare the HTML themselves. JavaScript can do that.
