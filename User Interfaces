1. if we have transitions on the data, we don't have to worry about the user interfaceâ€”we 
just manage the new state of our data.

2.  we have to change our views if the structure of our data changes. 
For example, when we add a Boolean flag to every product to track whether the product is in stock or not, 
and we want to display the out-of-stock products in gray, this would be a structure transition, not just a data transition. 
Once we account for the new structure for the first time though, updating that new flag becomes just a data transition that we don't have to worry about in the UI.
